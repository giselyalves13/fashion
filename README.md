# Fashion assistance
Recommendation system to match fashion clothes based on user input.

The data used in this project is sourced from social media and each piece of clothes in the data is identified.

The objective is to create a similarity model between social media data and the user's input. The output of this model is a set of clothes that are similar to the input. We use the clothes that appeared together with the output in a classification model. This model classifies these clothes as fashion or not, and use the probability to rank and recommend them.
